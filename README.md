NBA Scoring Evolution Analysis

Pace, Efficiency, and the 3-Point Revolution (1946–Present)

Project Overview
  This project investigates how and why NBA scoring has evolved from 1946 to the present. Rather than analyzing scoring averages alone, this study decomposes league scoring into its structural components:
  
- Pace (possessions per game)
- Offensive efficiency (points per possession)
- 3-point shot adoption
- By separating these components, the analysis identifies the true drivers behind historical scoring peaks, declines, and the modern scoring surge.

Research Questions

- Why did scoring peak in the late 1960s?
- Why did scoring decline through the late 1990s and early 2000s?
- Why did scoring surge again in the 2010s?
- Did the introduction of the 3-point line immediately increase scoring?

Methodology

  1. League-Wide Time Series Analysis
     - Aggregated game-level data to season-level metrics
     - Calculated average total points per game
      
  2. Scoring Decomposition
Using the identity:

Points Per Game = Posessions x Points Per Possesion 

Possessions were estimated using the standard approximation:

Possessions ≈ FGA + 0.44(FTA) - OREB + TOV 

This allowed scoring to be separated into:
 - Pace (possessions per game)
 - Efficiency (points per possession)

3. 3-Point Evolution

-  Calculated 3-point attempts per game
 - Computed 3-point attempt rate (3PA / FGA)
 - Examined the relationship between 3-point rate and offensive efficiency



Key Findings: 

1960s Scoring Peak
 - The scoring peak of the late 1960s was primarily driven by historically high pace. Possessions per game during this era were significantly higher than modern levels.

Late 1990s / Early 2000s Scoring Decline
 - The decline in scoring during this period was driven by both reduced pace and decreased offensive efficiency, creating a structural offensive trough.

Modern Scoring Surge (2014–Present)
 - The modern scoring increase reflects both moderate pace growth and a substantial rise in offensive efficiency. Points per possession reached historical highs during this period.

The 3-Point Revolution
 - Although the 3-point line was introduced in 1979, it did not immediately increase scoring. Meaningful impact occurred decades later as 3-point attempt rate surged. Increased 3-point adoption is positively associated with higher offensive efficiency.
